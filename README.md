Tacoya is a food-truck app that lets users input the names of tacos they'd like to eat and whenever a user submits a taco, the app displays the taco on the left side of the page -- waiting to be picked up. Then each taco in the waiting area also has a `Pick Up!` button. When the user clicks it, the taco moves to the right side of the page. Tacoya also stores every taco in a database, whether it has been picked up or not.
